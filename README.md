# Shopper-Spectrum-Customer-Segmentation-and-Product-Recommendations-in-E-Commerce
A machine learning project that segments customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and recommends products using collaborative filtering. Built with Python and Streamlit.

## üìå Problem Statement

The e-commerce industry produces vast amounts of transaction data daily. This project helps analyze such data to:

- Identify customer segments using clustering techniques
- Recommend products using collaborative filtering
- Improve customer engagement and drive business growth

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Segment customers using unsupervised learning (KMeans)
- Recommend similar products using item-based collaborative filtering
- Build an interactive web application using Streamlit

## üîç Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Remove missing `CustomerID`
- Exclude canceled invoices (`InvoiceNo` starting with 'C')
- Remove rows with non-positive `Quantity` or `UnitPrice`

### 2. Feature Engineering (RFM)

- **Recency**: Days since last purchase
- **Frequency**: Number of transactions
- **Monetary**: Total amount spent

### 3. Clustering

- Standardize RFM features
- Apply KMeans clustering
- Use Elbow and Silhouette Score to determine optimal clusters

### 4. Recommendation System

- Use cosine similarity on customer-product matrix
- Recommend top 5 similar products for any selected product
